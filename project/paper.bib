abstract="Vertex centric models for large scale graph processing are gaining traction due to their simple distributed programming abstraction. However, pure vertex centric algorithms under-perform due to large communication overheads and slow iterative convergence. We introduce GoFFish a scalable sub-graph centric framework co-designed with a distributed persistent graph storage for large scale graph analytics on commodity clusters, offering the added natural flexibility of shared memory sub-graph computation. We map Connected Components, SSSP and PageRank algorithms to this model and empirically analyze them for several real world graphs, demonstrating orders of magnitude improvements, in some cases, compared to Apache Giraph's vertex centric framework.",

        abstract = {Graph query processing is essential for graph analytics, but can be very time-consuming as it entails the NP-Complete problem of subgraph isomorphism. Traditionally, caching plays a key role in expediting query processing. We thus put forth GraphCache (GC), the first full-edged caching system for general subgraph/supergraph queries. We contribute the overall system architecture and implementation of GC. We study a number of novel graph cache replacement policies and show that different policies win over different graph datasets and/or queries; we therefore contribute a novel hybrid graph replacement policy that is always the
best or near-best performer. Moreover, we discover the related problem of cache pollution and propose a novel cache admission control mechanism to avoid cache pollution. Furthermore, we show that GC can be used as a front end, complementing any graph query processing method as a pluggable component. Currently, GC comes bundled with 3 top-performing filter-then-verify (FTV) subgraph query methods and 3 well-established direct subgraph-isomorphism (SI) algorithms - representing different categories of graph query processing research. Finally, we contribute a comprehensive performance evaluation of GC. We employ more than 6 million queries, generated using different workload generators, and executed against both real-world and synthetic graph datasets of different characteristics, quantifying the benefits and overheads, emphasizing the non-trivial lessons learned.},
